# Python Keystroke Injector

This project contains a Python script that uses the PyAutoGUI library to simulate keystrokes on the keyboard. The script reads a text file containing lines of code and simulates typing them character by character with random delays between keystrokes (Simulating human writting). It also simulates pressing the Enter key after each line is typed. In addition, it includes an extra "Enter" press to prevent auto-complete from IDE, which is applied to the first five lines of code.




## Potential Applications

1. **Demonstrations and Tutorials:** This script can be useful for creating demonstrations or tutorials where you want to show the process of writing code or text.
2. **Testing:** It can be used in software testing, particularly for applications that involve text input.
3. **Automating Repetitive Tasks:** If you have a task that involves repetitive text input, this script can automate it.
4. **Typing Practice:** With some modifications, this script can be used as a typing tutor, helping users to learn and practice typing skills.

## Installation

You can install the PyAutoGUI library using the following command in your terminal:

```pip install pyautogui```

## Usage

This script reads from a text file named keystokes.txt, so ensure this file exists and contains the text you want to type.

1. Open your console
2. To run this script go to the script folder and type: ```python keystroke_injection.py```
